# Profitable-App-Profiles
This project highlights how to perform data analysis for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. The apps are available on Google Play and in the App Store.  The company only builds apps that free to download and install, and their main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. The main goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets.  One thing that is notable for this company is that the revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use that app. Therefore in this project, the main goal is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.
